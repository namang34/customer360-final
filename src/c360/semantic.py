Semantic memory -- ChromaDB holding narrative patterns and bank policy text.

WHAT IS IN HERE, AND WHY IT IS NOT JUST A DICTIONARY
----------------------------------------------------
Two collections:

  patterns   One short description per inferred_state enum. Used to explain and
             sanity-check a synthesis conclusion in language rather than in
             affinity scores.

  policies   Bank eligibility and action-grounding text. The Action Proposer
             retrieves from this rather than carrying a hard-coded mapping from
             state to action.

The obvious objection is that with six possible actions a Python dict would do
the same job in four lines. The reason it is retrieval instead:

  1. A dict is a decision baked into code. Policy is a thing a bank CHANGES --
     eligibility thresholds move, products launch, a regulator restricts an
     outreach channel. Retrieval means updating a document, not redeploying.
  2. The action_subtype field is free text and must be justified. Retrieved
     policy gives the Action Proposer something concrete to ground a subtype in
     and to cite, instead of inventing a plausible-sounding label.
  3. The problem statement marks down "the most obvious single-agent-with-a-
     vector-database pattern". The answer to that is not to avoid retrieval; it
     is to use it where it earns its place -- grounding a bounded decision in
     policy -- rather than as the whole architecture.

INCREMENTAL UPSERT, NOT FULL REBUILD
------------------------------------
Required by the mid-term. `upsert` is content-hashed: re-running the seed is a
no-op, and editing one policy document re-embeds only that one.

THE EMBEDDING PROBLEM, AND AN HONEST ANSWER
-------------------------------------------
ChromaDB's default embedding function downloads an ONNX MiniLM model on first
use. That is fine on a laptop with internet and a disaster in a sandboxed
evaluation environment: the run dies on a network error having nothing to do with
the system being evaluated.

So the embedder is pluggable. The default is tried first; if it cannot be built,
`HashingEmbedder` -- a dependency-free, deterministic bag-of-words embedding
defined below -- is used instead. Over a corpus of ~20 short policy documents
that is genuinely adequate, and it means the test suite and the graded run never
depend on a download. `SemanticMemory.embedder_name` records which was used so
the evaluation write-up can state it plainly.

    A deterministic bag-of-words embedding with no model and no download.

    Words are hashed into a fixed number of buckets, counts are damped with
    1 + log(count) so a word repeated ten times does not dominate one used once,
    and the vector is L2-normalised so cosine similarity behaves.

    This is the "hashing trick" -- standard, old, and well suited to a small
    closed corpus of domain text where the vocabulary of a query ("hospital
    bill", "payment plan") overlaps the documents directly. It has no semantic
    generalisation: it cannot know that "infant" relates to "baby". That is an
    acceptable trade for never failing on a network error, and the real
    embedder is used whenever it is available.
