Right now the "decision" is a DUMMY rule that always says no_significant_event.
That is deliberate and is the whole point of step 2: it proves the plumbing --
replay, PII redaction, checkpoint validation, file writing, graded-timestamp
coverage -- works before any agent exists to blame.

In step 5 the dummy_decision() function below gets replaced by the Synthesis
Agent. Nothing else in this file has to change.
